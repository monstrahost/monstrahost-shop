{"name":"Monstrahost-shop","tagline":"minicart.js paypal shop for Monstra CMS","body":"\r\nEasy Shop\r\n================\r\nThis is a plugin for [Monstra CMS](http://monstra.org) that implements a very simple javascript PayPal shopping cart called [Minicart.js](http://minicartjs.com). It creates products in Monstra's flatfile data storage with simple attributes of title, SKU, photo, price, shipping price, price to ship additional quantities of the same item, and long-text (html and markdown allowed) description. There is no inventory management. \r\n\r\nThe cart is managed by Paypal and all order processing will be done _in your paypal account_. There is no 'backend' for order management with this plugin. The administration is used only to create products and display them on your website and then populate a paypal cart for checkout.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### Choose Currency and Set Paypal Email\r\n\r\n1. Go to Menu -> System -> Settings\r\n2. Choose your currency from the drop menu in Shop Settings\r\n3. Enter the email for your paypal account\r\n\r\n#### Create Products\r\n\r\nMenu -> Shop\r\n\r\n1.
