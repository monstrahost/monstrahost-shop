{"name":"Monstrahost-shop","tagline":"minicart.js paypal shop for Monstra CMS","body":"\r\nEasy Shop\r\n================\r\nThis is a plugin for [Monstra CMS](http://monstra.org) that implements a very simple javascript PayPal shopping cart called [Minicart.js](http://minicartjs.com). It creates products in Monstra's flatfile data storage with simple attributes of title, SKU, photo, price, shipping price, price to ship additional quantities of the same item, and long-text (html and markdown allowed) description. There is no inventory management. \r\n\r\nThe cart is managed by Paypal and all order processing will be done _in your paypal account_. There is no 'backend' for order management with this plugin. The administration is used only to create products and display them on your website and then populate a paypal cart for checkout.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n1. Go to _Admin Menu -> Extends -> Plugins -> Install New\r\n2. Select File or drop the _.zip_ file to upload\r\n3. Click 'Install'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Set Up Paypal and \r\n\r\n1. *Create a [PayPal Add to Cart Button](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/xcl/web-accept-to-sc-button-outside)*\r\n2. Go to Menu -> System -> Settings\r\n3. Choose your currency from the drop menu in Shop Settings\r\n4. Enter the email for your paypal account in Shop Settings\r\n5.

It probably needs to be rethemed.\r\n- Uninstalling *deletes all product data*\r\n\r\n\r\n### To Do\r\n\r\n1. Implement cart empty on return from completed payment. \r\n2. If we're managing the return request, maybe we can implement a digital download sales mechanism.\r\n","google":"UA-61560702-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
